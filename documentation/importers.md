# Importers

In this section we describe the Tombolo Digital Connector importers. The role of importers is to connect to external or local data sources and import the appropriate data by reformatting it into the centralised data format. 

Importers are of three types:

- **Subject Importers** import only Subjects. Examples include the LSOA and MSOA importers for the ONS Geographies Portal and the Health Organisation importer for NHS Choices data.
- **Timed Value Importers** import only Timed Values for an externally defined set of Subjects. Examples include the ONS Census importer that import census values for geographies such as LSOAs, MSOAs and Local Authorities.
- **Mixed Importers** import both Subjects and Timed Values. Examples include the Traffic Counts importer which imports both the locations of traffic counts as Subjects and the actual traffic counts as Timed Values.

We have built-in importers for a range of mostly public and open datasets. Users can use these importers directly to import the data they need in the processing. Additionally we have support for users to extend the Digital Connector with their own user defined custom importers for their local proprietary datasets. In the code base we have support tools such as Excel and Shapefile data extraction tools to make it easier to write custom importers.

## Built-in importers
Below you can find a list of built-in importers that were available at the time of writing. For an up to date list look at the [codebase](https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/TomboloDigitalConnector/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/org/tombolo/importer).

In the development of importers we have taken a pragmatic approach where we implement importers on need-to-use basis where the city challenges have been in the driver seat. As the project progresses we will be constantly supporting more data sources.
