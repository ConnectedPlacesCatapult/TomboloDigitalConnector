## Installing Java

### Check if java is already installed

- Click on the Start Button and type 'Command Prompt' and hit enter
- In the window type 'java -version'
- If your output looks like the one in the screenshot below, then probably java is not installed on your computer.
![Java not Installed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494868-7de2792c-d6bc-11e7-81b1-5b9726168cf4.png)

- It could be a possibility that java is installed but **Environment Variable** is not set.
- To check that go to 'C:\Program Files' and see if you see a folder named **Java**. If there is no folder like that 
then we can be sure that Java is not installed on your computer.
- In case you find the Java folder there, then skip to **Set Environment Variable** Section

### Install Java

#### Check for OS Architecture

- Before we start downloading Java, we need to check the what is your OS Architecture in order to install
 the correct version of Java
- There are two ways to do it:
    - Through File Explorer
        - Click on Start -> File Explorer,  if that option is not available, open any folder
        - Right Click on 'This PC' and choose Properties as shown in the screenshot below
        ![Computer Properties](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494857-7d06ce40-d6bc-11e7-99cf-b46a15f37e68.png)
        - Once done look for the 'System Type' on a window similar to the one below
        ![OS Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494861-7d4fbad8-d6bc-11e7-8d7e-28b299621a11.png)
        - If your system type is '64 bit operating system' then your system has 64 bit architecture
    - Through Command Prompt
        - Click on the start button and type ‘command prompt’, click on the application to open. 
        Once your command prompt is open type either of the following commands in order to get the architecture of the system
            - wmic os get osarchitecture  
            ![OS Arc Command 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494860-7d37bf3c-d6bc-11e7-85e5-10f1f35addda.png)
            - echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%  
            ![OS Arc Command 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494858-7d1f2788-d6bc-11e7-8e12-e6c06d10163a.png)

#### Download and Install Java

- Once you know the architecture information of your system, go [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- Accept the License and choose the version of **JDK** that suits the version of your operating system, e.g. if 
your system is 32 bit choose **'Windows x86'**, if it is 64 bit choose **'Windows x64'**
- In my case it happens to be 64 bit architecture, thus we are downloading ‘Windows x64’ version.
![Java Download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494875-7e7da83e-d6bc-11e7-8038-3c32e770e783.png)
- Once downloaded, double click on the downloaded file, based on your security setting you might get a dialog to confirm opening of the .exe file, just click Run. Now you should see a dialog like this

- Click Next. On the next screen make note of the installation directory, in my case it is installing in 
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_151\ which you can see at the bottom left side of the screen. This is required to set 
the environment variable at a later stage  
![JDK installation folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494872-7e45c518-d6bc-11e7-89ee-1429577a5d61.png)
- Click Next. The installation will begin, while installing it may ask you to change the installation directory for 
**JRE**, just let it set to default and click Next.  
![JRE Installation Folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494871-7e2cadf8-d6bc-11e7-84fc-10864c159c69.png)

## Installing Git

### Check if Git is already installed

- Lets first check if Git is installed on your machine or not. Open a new **Command prompt** 
window and type ```git --version```, if you see something like below then we could say that git is not 
installed on your computer. It could be that Git is installed but **Environment Variable** is not set. 
You could check that by going to the ```C:\Program Files``` if you would see a folder named **Git** then you just need 
to set **Environment Variable** path. If that is the case please feel free to the section 
where we are setting **Environment Variable**  
![Git not installed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494892-8011399a-d6bc-11e7-82a9-7efc9b2bf130.png)

###### Congratulations, you now have git installed on your machine.

##### Now that we have all the dependencies installed, let’s start working with Tombolo

## Clone Tombolo Digital Connector Repository

- To clone Tombolo Digital Connector repository, click [here](https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/TomboloDigitalConnector) 
then click on **Clone or Download** and copy the path
![Git tombolo clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494907-8183c6b2-d6bc-11e7-8ad5-e743b46513ef.png)
- Open a new **Command Prompt** and make sure that you present working directory is your home directory. 
You can check that by looking the path in the **Command Prompt** window before **>**, in my case is looks like this
![Check present working dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494912-81f2adde-d6bc-11e7-9de5-0f40a097bba9.png)
- If yours also follows the same pattern as ```C:\Users\<user-name>``` then you are good to go. If not then change 
it by typing ```cd C:\Users\<user-name>```. Now that we are in our home directory, we can type following 
commands to clone **TomboloDigitalConnector** repo.

```bash
cd Desktop
mkdir Tombolo
cd Tombolo
git clone https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/TomboloDigitalConnector.git
```

- Now wait for it to download, when it is downloaded you would see something like below.
![Git cloning tombolo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494906-8167d1e6-d6bc-11e7-951c-8d898167e836.png)
- Now type ```cd TomboloDigitalConnector```.
- We have rename 2 project files **gradle.properties.example** and **apikeys.properties.example**. 
To do that just type the following commands in **Command Prompt**

```bash
rename gradle.properties.example gradle.properties
rename apikeys.properties.example apikeys.properties
``` 

### Setup Databases

#### Main Database

- Type the following commands

```bash
psql -U postgres
Enter the password for the account and hit enter (You have set this password while installing postgres)
CREATE USER tombolo WITH PASSWORD ‘tombolo’;
CREATE DATABASE tombolo WITH ENCODING=UTF8;
``` 
![Pg create role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494853-7c9cefd4-d6bc-11e7-8838-41598ffabbfa.png)
![Pg create database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494855-7cd1b200-d6bc-11e7-83f1-4dd434831d3e.png)

- Make **tombolo** a **superuser**

```bash
ALTER USER tombolo WITH SUPERUSER;
```
![Pg alter role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494856-7cee79f8-d6bc-11e7-8767-df5edc9f069d.png)

- Type ```\q``` to quit
- We now need to create **postgis** extension

```bash
psql -d tombolo -U tombolo
Enter the password as tombolo and now Type the following commands
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
SET NAMES ‘UTF8’;
```
![Pg create extension](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494854-7cb9e724-d6bc-11e7-8391-0e02f9bdf069.png)

- Type ```\q``` to quit
- Now run the sql script to setup your database

```bash
psql -d tombolo -U tombolo < src\main\resources\sql\create_database.sql
Enter the password as ‘tombolo’
```
![Tombolo script output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494821-79893352-d6bc-11e7-8447-7f86b0a3fd61.png)

#### Test Database

- The steps for setting up the test database is same as setting up the main database. Thus follow the steps 
starting from **Main Database** section and replace **tombolo** with **tombolo_test** everywhere even 
for the passwords. Below are just the screenshots for the steps:
![Tombolo Test database](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494852-7c82926a-d6bc-11e7-8ec8-c6299e365501.png)
![Tombolo Test database 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19670372/33494851-7c6ad0f8-d6bc-11e7-9074-9b71f0482550.png)

###### Congratulations now your both the databases are setup. 

### Build and Run the project

#### Build

- Now you are all set to build the project **TomboloDigitalConnector**. To build the project 
in **Command Prompt** type the following

```bash
gradle clean build
```
- Running the aforementioned command should start downloading the packages required to run **DigitalConnector**, 
once the packages is downloaded it will start building the **DigitalConnector** and start running the tests, on a
