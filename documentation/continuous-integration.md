# Continuous Integration

We're using [Wercker](http://wercker.com/) for CI. Commits and PRs will be run
against the CI server automatically. If you don't have access, you can use the
Wercker account in the 1Password Servers vault to add yourself.

If you need to run the CI environment locally:

1. Install the [Wercker CLI](http://wercker.com/cli/install)
2. Run `wercker build`

The base image is generated with the very simple Dockerfile in the root of this
project. To push a new image to DockerHub you will need access to our DockerHub
account. If you don't have access, you can use the DockerHub account in the
1Password Servers vault to add yourself.

If you need new versions of PostgreSQL, Java, etc, you can update the image:

```
docker build -t tombolo .
docker images
# Look for `tombolo` and note the IMAGE ID
docker tag <IMAGE_ID> fcclab/tombolo:latest
docker push fcclab/tombolo
```
