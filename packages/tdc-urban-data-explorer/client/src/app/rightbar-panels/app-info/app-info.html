  We have designed this tool to support you in two main activities:

  - To make it easy to explore curated indexes and geospatial data made available through the Tombolo Digital Connector. The Tombolo Digital Connector is an open source tool that makes it easy to combine different datasets in an efficient, transparent and reproducible way. Feel free to have a look at some of our indexes and access to services analyses using the panel on the left. If you want to see how they were made using the Tombolo Digital Connector try downloading the recipe used to create it!
  - To enable you to upload and visualise your own exports from the Tombolo Digital Connector. Once you have uploaded your connector export (or other geospatial data) you can style your map in a way that suits you, save it and even share it with others. This playground section of the app even lets you compare different geospatial layers while controlling the visual style of your data. Why not compare air quality and green space, or look at the relationship between access to GPâ€™s and levels of deprivation?

  We have designed this tool with exploration and quick visualisation in mind.  So,
  have a go and see what insights you can generate using your geospatial data and outputs from the Tombolo Digital Connector.
