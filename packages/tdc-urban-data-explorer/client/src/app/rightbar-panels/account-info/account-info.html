  Account Benefits
</h3>

<div class="sidebar-content with-padding" Markdown>
  By signing up for an account, you’ll be able to save any maps that you generate along with their styling and layering. This will give you the opportunity to upload bespoke geospatial data and develop the story that you want to tell with your visualisation.

  If you don’t sign up for an account, you can create temporary visualisations but once you leave, they’ll be lost.
